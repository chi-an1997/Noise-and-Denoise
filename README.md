Salt and Pepper Noise:
Salt and pepper noise is an impulse type of noise in images. This noise is generally caused by errors in data transmission, failure in memory cell or analog-to-digital converter errors.

Median Blur:
The median filter is a non-linear digital filtering technique, often used to remove noise from an image or signal. Such noise reduction is a typical pre-processing step to improve the results of later processing. Median filtering is very widely used in digital image processing because, under certain conditions, it preserves edges while removing noise, also having applications in signal processing.
